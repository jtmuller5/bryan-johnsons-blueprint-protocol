# <a name="protocol"></a>🔵 The Blueprint Protocol

## About Blueprint

Blueprint is a data-driven health optimization protocol developed by Bryan Johnson and his team. After decades of entrepreneurship (including selling Braintree/Venmo for $800M) and experiencing chronic health issues, Johnson developed a system that helped him achieve some of the world's best comprehensive biomarkers.

## Core Principles

### 1. Eliminate Self-Destructive Behavior
- Identify and address destructive patterns
- Create clear boundaries for decision-making
- Implement systematic controls over impulsive choices

### 2. Let Your Body Lead
- Use hundreds of biological measurements to make decisions
- Follow evidence-based scientific protocols
- Prioritize organ health over mental cravings

### 3. Expand Your Health Horizons
- Embrace technological and scientific progress
- Take incremental steps toward optimal health
- Build sustainable, measurable improvements

### 4. Focus on Data-Driven Results
- Use STEM principles for health decisions
- Measure and optimize biological processes
- Automate health decisions where possible

## Vision
Blueprint represents a shift from traditional health paradigms to a data-driven approach for optimal longevity. The protocol aims to answer the question: "Are we the first generation that won't die?" It combines cutting-edge science, technology, and systematic measurement to optimize human health.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This protocol was developed through extensive research and personal experimentation. Always consult with healthcare professionals before making significant changes to your health routine.
